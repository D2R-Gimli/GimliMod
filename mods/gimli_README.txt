[INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS]
----------------------
Step 1: copy the folder "mods" into your D2R installation folder like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected"

Step 2: go to your folder "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected" and copy the file "Settings.json"

Step 3: create a folder in this directory named "mods". Go into the folder mods and create another folder called "gimli" and paste your Settings.json file into this folder.
		You may have to set up your ingame spell hotkeys back again (but only once)

Step 4: Open the Battle.net Launcher, click the "settings" icon (gearwheel), got to "game settings"
		activate "additional command line arguments"
		type in or attach to already used arguments "-mod gimli -txt"
		
Step 5: start D2R and enjoy a nice mod :)



[OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS]
----------------------
Note: You have to redo this after each patch from Blizzard or and updated version of the mod.
For lower delays / loading times you can completely extract the game files with Ladiks Casc Viewer (http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html)
You need to "Open Storage" the game files from your D2R directory, then on the left field, expand the folder "data", then expand the next "data" folder again.
The data folder which have the folders "global", "hd" and "local" inside needs to be extracted (right click -> extract (choose a path with enough space for ~65GB) This may take a while
After the extraction, cutout/move the folders "global", "hd" and "local" to your main game into the "Data" folder there. Usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\Data\"
In this folder you should now see the following folders "config", "data", "global", "hd", "indices" and "local".
Now you can copy over the files from my mod (same 3 folders) and overwrite the existing files.
To start D2R with the local extracted files (including the mod now) you have to set start arguments on the D2R Launcher (in Game settings)
